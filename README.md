# React_Node_JWT-FullStack
Full-stack application focussed on JWT authentication, using ReactJs in frontend and NodeJs in the backend, with GraphQL, Apollo Client, and Postgres as database complimenting the project. (With reference to Ben Awad's youtube tutorial.)

## Run Node server

#### For this you need to install `NodeJs` and `postgres` in your system
After downloading the repository to your local navigate to the `server` folder in terminal and run 
````base
npm i
````
(or)

````base
yarn
````
And then run 
````base
npm start
````

Note: npm and/or yarn should be pre-installed
This server uses postgres as database. You can configure it's credintial from `ormconfig.json`.


## Run Node ReactJs

Assuming you already have nodeJs, you can directly navigate into `web` folder and run either of the following commad in command line 

````base
npm i
````
(or)

````base
yarn
````
And the run 
````base
npm start
````
